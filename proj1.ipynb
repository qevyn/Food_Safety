The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored.

When you group by name, there can be multiple restaurants that share the same name like chains of restaurants like Chili's or Olive Garden. When you group by address, you can see how many restaurants share the same address; for example, in a mall, there are many restaurants and food places within it such that all of them would share the same address.

    "Some record have missing postal codes because they are pop-up shops and food trucks like \"Mobi Munch Inc.\" and \"Banh Mi Zon\" which have the address of \"Off The Grid\". Since these types of food places do not have permanent addresses since they show up at different cities at different times, they would not have a ZIP code. Other restaurants that have missing ZIP codes could be due to errors while entering the data. Another reason why some records have missing postal codes could be because the business is located within another business such that they would share the same address and no ZIP code is entered into the data set for that record. An example of such business is the Subway on Southside Berkeley that also has a ramen business within it.  "

The owner listed the locations at several different addresses on Google with one being at 94587 and one at 94545.

    "1. `count null`: The number of missing values for the zip code.\n",
    "2. `count non null`: The number of present values for the zip code.\n",
    "3. `fraction null`: The fraction of values that are null for the zip code.\n",

    "Your data frame should be sorted by the fraction null in descending order. The first two rows of your answer should include postal code 94107 and 94124.\n",

Whereas, 'complaint' could be a type of inspection where the business gets an inspection due to customers' complaints. From the occurences of each value, there are certainly a lot more 'routine' inspections and there are hardly any 'complaint' inspections. Since there is only 1 'complaint' versus 14,221 'routine', we can't really use these values for further analysis because it would be nearly impossible to find a viable pattern or further learnings.

    "   Based on the result of the second cell, the range of years covered in this data set is from 2015 to 2018, inclusively. Based on the third to sixth cell, I would say that there are roughly the same number of inspections each year. I came to this conclusion because looking at the third cell, the period of inspections in 2015 began almost at the end of January to the end of December, where there were 3,305 inspections. In 2018, the period of inspections only show records from beginning of January to almost the end of January with 308 inspections. The year 2016 and 2017 are the only two years where they have roughly the same start and end dates for their periods of inspections, resulting in them having roughly the same amount of inspections (5,443 and 5,166 respectively) in these two years. Thus, taking into account that if the periods of inspections in 2015 and in 2018 spanned across the majority of the year like in 2016 and in 2017, then we should expect that there are roughly the same number of inspections each year.

    "The mode is 100 so most restaurants get scores of 100. The tail is left-skewed, indicating that most restaurants do not get low scores . There are strange gaps towards the right, which mean that inspectors tend to give out certain scores due to habit or many restaurants tend to have the same violations and therefore resulting in the same score. The anamolous values I notice is that the difference between the number of 100 scores and 98 scores is really bizarre. This could be because a score of 98 is very close to 100 and inspectors tend to just give out 100 scores to restaurants, which could explain why there are so many restaurants with scores of 100."

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",

    "If a restaurant's score improves from the first to the second inspection, I would expect that the location of the restaurant's marker on the scatter plot to be above the red reference line. When you look at the scatter plot, there are three regions where the line can fall on: above the red linear line, below the red line, and on the red line. The red line has an equation of y = x meaning that its x-coordinate and y-coordinate are the same. Thus, from the scatter graph, I see that over half of the restaurants fall in the region above the line and a little less than half fall underneath the line. Some falls on the line indicating that there were no improvements while more than half of the restaurants improved from first to the second inspection. \n",
